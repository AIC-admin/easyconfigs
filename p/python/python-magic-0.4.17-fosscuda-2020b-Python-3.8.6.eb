This\nfunctionality is exposed to the command line by the Unix command\n`file`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\n>>> import magic\n>>> magic.from_file(\"testdata/test.pdf\")\n'PDF document, version 1.2'\n# recommend using at least the first 2048 bytes, as less can produce incorrect identification\n>>> magic.from_buffer(open(\"testdata/test.pdf\", \"rb\").read(2048))\n'PDF document, version 1.2'\n>>> magic.from_file(\"testdata/test.pdf\", mime=True)\n'application/pdf'\n```\n\nThere is also a `Magic` class that provides more direct control,\nincluding overriding the magic database file and turning on character\nencoding detection.  This is not recommended for general use.  In\nparticular, it's not safe for sharing across multiple threads and\nwill fail throw if this is attempted.\n\n```python\n>>> f = magic.Magic(uncompress=True)\n>>> f.from_file('testdata/test.gz')\n'ASCII text (gzip compressed data, was \"test\", last modified: Sat Jun 28\n21:32:52 2008, from Unix)'\n```\n\nYou can also combine the flag options:\n\n```python\n>>> f = magic.Magic(mime=True, uncompress=True)\n>>> f.from_file('testdata/test.gz')\n'text/plain'\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nThe current stable version of python-magic is available on PyPI and\ncan be installed by running `pip install python-magic`.\n\nOther sources:\n\n- PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic/\n- GitHub: https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic\n\nThis module is a simple wrapper around the libmagic C library, and\nthat must be installed as well:\n\n### Debian/Ubuntu\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install libmagic1\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nYou'll need DLLs for libmagic.  @julian-r maintains a pypi package with the DLLs, you can fetch it with:\n\n```\npip install python-magic-bin\n```\n\n### OSX\n\n- When using Homebrew: `brew install libmagic`\n- When using macports: `port install file`\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- 'MagicException: could not find any magic files!': some\n  installations of libmagic do not correctly point to their magic\n  database file.  Try specifying the path to the file explicitly in the\n  constructor: `magic.Magic(magic_file=\"path_to_magic_file\")`.\n\n- 'WindowsError: [Error 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application':\n  Attempting to run the 32-bit libmagic DLL in a 64-bit build of\n  python will fail with this error.  Here are 64-bit builds of libmagic for windows: https://github.com/pidydx/libmagicwin64.\n  Newer version can be found here: https://github.com/nscaife/file-windows.\n\n- 'WindowsError: exception: access violation writing 0x00000000 ' This may indicate you are mixing\n  Windows Python and Cygwin Python. Make sure your libmagic and python builds are consistent.\n\n\n## Bug Reports\n\npython-magic is a thin layer over the libmagic C library.\nHistorically, most bugs that have been reported against python-magic\nare actually bugs in libmagic; libmagic bugs can be reported on their\ntracker here: https://bugs.astron.com/my_view_page.php.  If you're not\nsure where the bug lies feel free to file an issue on GitHub and I can\ntriage it.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nTo run the tests across a variety of linux distributions (depends on Docker):\n\n```\n./test_docker.sh\n```\n\nTo run tests locally across all available python versions:\n\n```\n./test/run.py\n```\n\nTo run against a specific python version:\n\n```\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 python3 test/test.py\n```\n\n## libmagic python API compatibility\n\nThe python bindings shipped with libmagic use a module name that conflicts with this package.  To work around this, python-magic includes a compatibility layer for the libmagic API.  See [COMPAT.md](COMPAT.md) for a guide to libmagic / python-magic compatibility.\n\n## Versioning\n\nMinor version bumps should be backwards compatible.  Major bumps are not.\n\n## Author\n\nWritten by Adam Hupp in 2001 for a project that never got off the\nground.  It originally used SWIG for the C library bindings, but\nswitched to ctypes once that was part of the python standard library.\n\nYou can contact me via my [website](http://hupp.org/adam) or\n[GitHub](http://github.com/ahupp).\n\n## License\n\npython-magic is distributed under the MIT license.  See the included\nLICENSE file for details.\n\nI am providing code in the repository to you under an open source license.
